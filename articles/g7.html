            Held in Cornwall on 11th July 2021, the G7 summit took place, comprising of leading powers in the world such as Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK, United States as well as invitees including Australia, India, South Korea, and South Africa. 
            </p>

            <p>The agenda for this G7 summit included a variety of topics comprising of the ‘100-day mission’ to improve readiness for future pandemics, to protect the planet by turbocharging global green growth, tackling the ongoing battle with climate change, and promoting future prosperity by enforcing methods used by companies such as relying on fair trade produce. </p>

            <p>British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, voiced the concerns of a future pandemic and pledged for the G7 summit to improve the global response if there will be another virus on the loose. Boris Johnson proposed to instate a five-point plan, which was to set up zoonotic disease research stations around the world, improving vaccine production facilities, to design an early warning measure that will alert leaders if there is the threat of a disease outbreak and finally the quick agreement of future health emergencies if there are any. Along with Boris’s plan for any future pandemics, the G7 also discussed the ‘100-day mission’ which was an ambitious mission to have safe and quick vaccines within a hundred days of a threat being identified. On the 12th of June, the report on the ‘100-day mission for diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines to respond to future pandemic threats.’ In the report, it is found that the G7 will attempt to make vaccines ready to produce in enormous quantities for global deployment, an initial regimen of therapeutics as well as finally making accurate tests to see if a person has a future virus. </p>

            <p>Another major problem that was discussed was the protection of the planet we live on. The G7 leaders have started investing in the infrastructure to propel green growth as well as the launch of the 500 million pound ‘Blue Planet Fund’ to protect the ocean and marine wildlife from extensive deaths from reasons such as over-fishing or environmental destruction to the world’s oceans. The ‘Blue Planet Fund’ will be running for at least 5 years, until 2026 and will target places such as the oceans near the Pacific islands, Ghana, and Indonesia. Another fund that will be endorsed by the G7 will be the Nature Compact, which will reverse the loss of biodiversity in nature by placing protection laws on 30 percent of the land in the world and 30 percent of the oceans globally. Featuring in these talks about green growth was Sir David Attenborough, an esteemed environmentalist who has already made huge leaps in securing the safety of thousands of animals by spreading popularity of the dangers animals and the world live with. David Attenborough will address invitee world leaders on acting in securing the future of our planet and ensuring it is a safe happy one. </p>

            <p>“The natural world today is greatly diminished. That is undeniable. Our climate is warming fast. That is beyond doubt. Our societies and nations are unequal and that is sadly is plain to see. But the question science forces us to address specifically in 2021 is whether because of these intertwined facts we are on the verge of destabilising the entire planet? If that is so, then the decisions we make this decade - in particular, the decisions made by the most economically advanced nations - are the most important in human history.” – David Attenborough.</p>

            <p>Among all the serious talk at the G7 summit, the queen devised several comedic jokes. One of which was her persistent efforts to cut a cake at the G7 summit. But with a sword. The Queen also made a joke whilst in a photo shoot, making every world leader smile more than they originally had. </p>

            <p>So overall, the G7 summit went off without a hitch, going through major topics regarding the future of the world as well as the production and implication of a plan in the face of a future pandemic, which will shake the world more than Covid-19 has. </p>
