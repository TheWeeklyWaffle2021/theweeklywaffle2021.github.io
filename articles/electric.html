        <h1>Manufacturer war sends panic through the car industry</h1>

            <p>With electric cars gaining increasing popularity, one of the greatest automotive wars has begun. Furthermore, the UK Government have declared that no petrol cars will be sold after 2030. These events have inspired manufacturers to take the opportunity to dominate the market.</p>
            <p>Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla, is currently leading the way in the battle of the cars as they have gained popularity.</p>
            <p>However other manufacturers are joining in, such as BMW, Renault, Mercedes, Porsche, Volkswagen, Audi, Jaguar, Toyota, Ford, and Kia. They are all building electric cars to prepare for the future.</p>
            <p>A major problem that customers are fearing is the price of the cars, as some are proving to be expensive, which is not as appealing as the cheaper (but less eco-friendly) petrol or diesel cars.</p>
            <p>This monumental demand on manufacturers to build electric cars at an impossible rate is putting too much pressure on car brands, pressure that they may not be able to handle. In simple words, people are expecting too much from the car industry.</p>
            <p>However, there is another side to this war. Motorsport is a completely different front in which endurance racing is being used to test the limits of electric vehicles and show them off to the public.</p>
            <p>Below is Toyotaâ€™s hypercar which will be competing against other large car manufacturers.</p>
        </div>

        <div style="position: absolute; top: 2150px; left: 50px; width: 1750px; height: auto;">
            <p>With the World Endurance Championship announcing the addition of a hypercar class (cars that run half electric and half petrol), companies have rushed to the opportunity to compete, with planned entries coming from Peugeot, Porsche, Audi, Ferrari, BMW, and Glickenhaus. All will be competing in one of the most prestigious races, which is the 24 hours of Le Mans. This well renowned race takes endurance to the extreme, providing one of the most exciting events of the year. The stakes are high as whoever wins could be the next king of the car industry.</p>
            <p>The era of electric car is coming whether we like it or not, and although there are negatives, such as the price, there are positives, like convenience. However, this upcoming age of cars could either make or break the industry and manufacturers should not be put under pressure to build or be put out of business. Some might say that petrol cars will always be better than the new alternative, but it is intriguing as to where this journey is going to. </p>
