        <h1>Sadiq secures second term</h1>
        <i><p>

        <p>On 9th May 2021, the entire nation watched as the results of the London Mayor election voting became evident and everyone realised who the new Mayor of London would be.</p>
        <p>Many people in London had registered to vote by 19th April, anticipating the victory of their party. 20 candidates competed for the glorious prize as the London Mayor, including those from major parties such as Labour and Conservative. This election saw the rise of influencers such as Niko Omilana, a Youtuber that has over 3.5 million subscribers and the founder of the Niko Defence League (the NDL), as well as Max Fosh, a Youtuber who has just over 400,000 subscribers. After the voting commenced on 6th May, everyone rushed to get their votes in at the polling stations which were scattered across London, in schools and community halls, hoping for their first preference to be elected Mayor.</p>
        <p>The election works on the basis that if a candidate receives more than 50% of the first preference vote, they win. However, if no candidate gets more than 50% of the first preference votes, all candidates will be eliminated apart from the top two, who will advance to the second round. The second round consists of a count of the first preference votes and any second preference votes one of the top two. If a person voted for candidates that did not make the second round, their votes are then discarded and cannot be used. The winning candidate in this second round has the majority of support from the voters who expressed their preference in the top two candidates. However, the 2021 election using the supplementary vote system, in which people have a first and second preference, is said to be the last time this system will be used.</p>
        <p>There will always be a few people who spoil their ballot in an election for various reasons; maybe  the person dislikes all the options or they do not fully understand what they are supposed to do with the ballot paper they mark it in a way that was unintended. Unfortunately, this year, 114,201 first preference votes, which is 4.3 percent of the total amount of votes, were rejected in the election, doubling the previous record of 2 percent in 2004. The category that most rejected votes were concentrated in was for “voting for too many candidates.” This had an immense increase from 32,217 votes in this category in 2016 to 87,214 of them in 2021. Another category that rose, was the number of unmarked and uncertain ballots. However, the voters cannot be blamed for these issues, but rather the ballot itself. The voter might have tried to express their political views but marked the ballot in a way that confused other people. Usually, when there is a jump in the number of rejected votes, the format is to blame and, in this instance, it is true. The 2021 mayoral ballot paper is certainly among the more confusing that has been deployed in a British election.</p>
        <p>The rivalry that everyone has their eyes on was between Mr Khan and Mr Bailey. Shaun Bailey received 44.8 percent of the first and second round votes and increased the Conservative party’s vote share by 1.6 percent. The election was fair and true sportsmanship was shown by Shaun Bailey to his opponents as he congratulated everyone’s campaigns, even his rival of sorts, Mr Khan: “Well done, Sadiq, I’m genuine in that.” Despite the great campaign he ran, he felt as if he had been ignored by journalists and even politicians but was sincere and thanked the Londoners who voted for him. His 977,601 votes managed to trim the size of Sadiq Khan’s majority by 87,096 but this election had a lower turnout due to Covid-19. In the end, the Labour Party won 11 seats in the London Assembly, the Conservative Party won 9 seats, the Green Party won 3 seats and the Liberal Democrats won 2. To the surprise of some, UKIP managed to lose all their seats.</p>

            <p>Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the elections had to be delayed to 2021, meaning Sadiq Khan will have a reduced term, lasting 3 years until the next mayor election in 2024. However, many people overlooked the impressive performance of the Green Party, led by Sian Berry. The Green Party won 197,976 first preference votes and 486,798 second preference votes at the end of the election, easily coming in third place. This was the best performance the Green Party has ever had, winning 3 seats in the London Assembly.</p>
            <p>The results became clear. Labour had won the election. Victory shone on Sadiq Khan as he got the most seats in the London Assembly. Sadiq Khan has been re-elected as mayor of London for a second term and will be the mayor of London once again. </p>
