            <p>In a game overshadowed by reckless fans, last-minute heartbreak and racial abuse, Italy lifted the trophy two minutes before the clock struck 11, in front of 65000 England fans, all shocked to the core and silent with disappointment. England’s journey throughout the tournament had captured the hearts of English fans and neutrals alike, following their dismal exit against Croatia in the World Cup, in 2018. The nation had been ignited with fresh hope, hope that football could indeed come home. Sadly, it failed to, but take nothing away from the tenacious Italians, who were deserved winners in the end.</p>

            <p>England walked out into a warm, hazy summer evening, accompanied by the delight and uproar of the English fans, passionately chanting the national anthem. The match ball was delivered by a tiny electric car into the centre of the pitch, as it has done throughout the tournament. Then, it was the dream start for England. A floated cross into the box from Kieran Trippier was struck fiercely into the bottom corner by Luke Shaw, sending the England fans into delirium. English manager, Gareth Southgate however, stayed remarkably calm during the celebrations – he knew the show was not over yet, as we were soon to find out. The rest of the second half passed uneventfully. England were clearly on top, and Italy had been shell-shocked by the early goal and were forced to retreat into their own half. However, there were signs of optimism for the Italians, as they started to pick up the pace in the final 10 minutes of the first half – Federico Chiesa showed danger signs, as he picked up the ball, ran past two defenders and fired a shot just narrowly wide of the post. Both teams went into the tunnel at the end of the first half, with everything to play for.</p> 
                    
            <p>After a 15-minute interval, both teams ran out onto the pitch. The sun was beginning to drop, and the temperature dropped sharply as well. It was also rather apparent that it was going to rain. Nonetheless, Italy started the second half right on the money, they were sharp, first to every ball, and looked hungrier than England, who looked as if they had too much time to relax during half-time. Danger-man Chiesa caused England more problems, turning and twisting inside their penalty box, and drawing 1 great save from England goalie Jordan Pickford. It was not long before Italy scored. In the 66th minute, Italy had a corner ball. It was swung in, an Italy man got their head to it and the ball ricocheted into the path of Marco Verratti, who despite his small stature, got his head to the ball, drawing a fine save from Pickford. Pickford deflected the ball onto the post, where it then dropped kindly for Italy senior defender Leonardo Bonucci to stab the ball in from close range. Wembley went silent. Italy was on level terms. The Italians had got the goal they needed, but more importantly, they gained the confidence needed to cause more urgency in their play and unsettle the English defence more. After the goal, one could have expected of England to increase the urgency in their play and wake up, but they seemed shocked by Italy’s equaliser and retreated further back into their own half, like what Italy had done after going behind in the first half. Italy dominated the game for the next 10 minutes, shifting the ball up the pitch and creating one great chance, which left Italian forward Domenico Berardi alone with England keeper Pickford. England counted themselves lucky that Berardi was unable to convert that fantastic opportunity.</p>  
                    
            <p>By the end of the 90 minutes, both sets of players looked leggy and unhappy at the prospect of playing another 30 minutes of extra time. Not too many good chances were created in extra time, although Italy again were the team that pressed and played with more urgency.</p> 
                    
            <p>Then came the dreaded event of world football: the penalty shootout. It is the chance for a player to become the hero of their country, or to become the finger of blame for your country’s loss. Italy won the toss and elected to shoot first. Berardi converted the first penalty coolly, sending Pickford the wrong way. England captain and golden boy Harry Kane stepped up next. Giant Italian goalkeeper Donnarumma guessed the right way but could not keep out Kane’s fierce strike into the left bottom corner. Andrea Belotti then found his penalty saved by Pickford, and now England had the chance to take an advantage. Up stepped huge defender Harry Maguire, more known for his ability in the air than on the ball, to take England’s second penalty. Could he give England an advantage? An uneasy silence hung around Wembley Stadium. Maguire stepped up... and scored emphatically! Maguire absolutely bolted it into the top corner, even smashing a TV camera in the process!! </p>

                <p>The pressure was on Italy now to score, the man who scored their equaliser, Leonardo Bonucci, stepped up and struck it calmly above Pickford. Marcus Rashford, England’s national hero and MBE winner, had the chance to extend England’s advantage and put them within a penalty of becoming European champions. Rashford took a delayed run up, sent Donnarumma the wrong way, but hit the post! Rashford had done everything right but hit the target! England suffered a minor setback and were now on level terms with Italy. Bernardeschi of Italy stepped up next, coolly slotting it down the middle and sending Pickford the wrong way. The pressure was now on England to score, young talisman Jadon Sancho stepped up to take the penalty. He saw his penalty palmed away by Donnarumma! What a turnaround in events! England were now on the brink of defeat! </p>
            
                <p>It was now up to Jorginho, the man with Run, Hop and Shoot penalty technique. It had been very efficient in the past and he had a 100% scoring rate of penalties in international football. He just had to score one more, for his country to be crowned European Champions. Jorginho jumped and shot, but it was palmed away by Pickford! England fans were jubilant again, and it was yet another twist in the tale! Pickford had saved England!</p>
            
                <p>Sadly, it just was not to be for England. 19-year-old Bukayo Saka stepped up to the spot, but... saw his penalty saved. What a sad ending it was for the young Arsenal sensation. Italy was crowned winners, but England should be proud that they made it so far, and it is only an experience the players will learn from- there is always the World Cup, a bigger fish, to come next year!!</p>
